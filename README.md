Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the starter project
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
  - Dbt core,Dbt PostGres
  - Python 3.8+
  - Git
  - PostgreSQL database (version 9.3 or higher)

ðŸ’¾ Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

To ensure this dbt project runs correctly, you must first create the necessary source tables using our provided schema dump.

### 1. Create the Database

Start by creating an empty database in your local PostgreSQL instance (e.g., named `dbt_source_db`).

    psql -U your_admin_user -c "CREATE DATABASE dbt_source_db;


### 2. Load the Schema

 Use the provided schema-only dump file to create the table structures.
      
       Update 'your_user' and 'dbt_source_db' as needed
    psql -U your_user -d dbt_source_db -f setup/schema_only.sql

### 3. Refrence to  My Postgres Database

  The below link provides you a overview of my database, What schemas I have used and how i have referenced my schemas to one another.

### 4. PowerBi DashBoard
  
   This project integrates Between dbt,PostGres and Power BI. The repository houses the dbt models that structure the data as well as stored in Database and the final `.pbix` report, providing **dynamic visualization of [key metric, e.g., customer acquisition trends].**
